    Component responsible for forwarding incoming messages to appropriate peer nodes.

    The Forwarder handles:
      - Relaying messages received from one node to others in the federation.
      - Applying any forwarding policies (e.g., proxy mode, rate limiting).
      - Ensuring duplicate messages are not resent.
      - Integrating with the CommunicationsManager to obtain current connections.

    This class is designed to run asynchronously, leveraging the existing connection pool
